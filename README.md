Here, I analyzed workforce data to identify patterns and root causes of employee attrition, providing actionable insights that supported HR in making data-driven decisions and developing proactive retention strategies.
Using Power BI, I explored employee attrition across factors such as gender, satisfaction ratings, and education levels, uncovering actionable insights that empowered HR to make data-driven decisions.

# Objectives
1. Which departments require urgent retention strategies due to high employee attrition?
2. What age groups and genders are most affected by attrition, and how should HR tailor retention efforts?
3. How does educational background impact employee turnover, and what hiring strategy adjustments are needed?
4. Which job roles report the lowest satisfaction, and how does this correlate with attrition trends?
5. Is there a gender-based disparity in average monthly income, and what are the implications for pay equity?

# Insights & Recommendations
1. The R&D department shows the highest attrition at 56.1%, followed by Sales at 38.8%, indicating urgent turnover issues. These departments should be prioritized for retention through focused career development, stronger incentives, and regular employee engagement.
  
2. Attrition is highest among employees aged 25–34 and this group likely includes early-career professionals and recent graduates.o improve retention, organizations should focus on structured onboarding, clear career paths, mentorship, and flexible work options that support growth and work-life balance.

3. Employees with Life Sciences, Medical, and Marketing backgrounds show the highest attrition, led by Life Sciences (89 exits). This highlights possible role mismatch or high demand. Strengthening role-fit assessments, onboarding, and career path clarity can improve retention.

4. Laboratory Technicians and Research Scientists report the most dissatisfaction (ratings 1 and 2) and make up a large share of the workforce—raising attrition risk. Leadership should explore role-specific challenges and improve support, feedback mechanisms, and recognition to boost satisfaction and retention.

5. Males earn an average of $6.69K, while females earn $6.38K—reflecting a 4.6% pay gap. Though relatively small, this gap may influence morale and retention. A pay equity audit and transparent compensation reviews are advised to promote fairness and trust.
