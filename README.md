# HR_analytics_project
Explored company data to uncover trends in employee attrition across key factors, providing actionable insights to help the HR team make informed decisions and proactively improve retention.
Power BI was used in this project to explore attrition across various factors—including gender, satisfaction ratings, and education levels—resulting in actionable insights to support HR decision-making.

# Objectives
1. Which departments require urgent retention strategies due to high employee attrition?
2. What age groups and genders are most affected by attrition, and how should HR tailor retention efforts?
3. How does educational background impact employee turnover, and what hiring strategy adjustments are needed?
4. Which job roles report the lowest satisfaction, and how does this correlate with attrition trends?
5. Is there a gender-based disparity in average monthly income, and what are the implications for pay equity?


# Findings and Insights
1. The R&D department shows the highest attrition at 56.1%, followed by Sales at 38.8%, indicating urgent turnover issues. These departments should be prioritized for retention through focused career development, stronger incentives, and regular employee engagement.
  
2.Attrition is highest among employees aged 25–34 and this group likely includes early-career professionals and recent graduates. To improve retention, organizations should consider structured onboarding, clear career growth paths, mentorship programs, and flexible work options that support development and work-life balance at this foundational career stage.

3. Employees with Life Sciences, Medical, and Marketing backgrounds show the highest attrition, led by Life Sciences (89 exits). This highlights possible role mismatch or high demand. Strengthening role-fit assessments, onboarding, and career path clarity can improve retention.

4. Laboratory Technicians and Research Scientists report the most dissatisfaction (ratings 1 and 2) and make up a large share of the workforce—raising attrition risk. Leadership should explore role-specific challenges and improve support, feedback mechanisms, and recognition to boost satisfaction and retention.

5. Males earn an average of $6.69K, while females earn $6.38K—reflecting a 4.6% pay gap. Though relatively small, this gap may influence morale and retention. A pay equity audit and transparent compensation reviews are advised to promote fairness and trust.
